The CloudCheckr Developer Community has a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CloudCheckr/Developer-Community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), you can expect to be treated with respect at all times when interacting with this project.

Contributing Code
-----------------
A good pull request:

-  Is clear.
-  Follows the existing style of the code base (PEP-8).
-  Has comments included as needed.

-  Example output is included to verify how the script runs successfully.
-  If it adds/changes a public API, it must also include documentation
   for those changes.
   
- If it is a feature, name the branch feature/branch-name.
- If it is a bug, name the branch bug/branch-name.

Reporting An Issue/Feature
--------------------------
First, check to see if there's an existing issue/pull request for the
[bug](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)/[feature](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md). All issues are at
https://github.com/CloudCheckr/Developer-Community/issues and pull reqs are at
https://github.com/CloudCheckr/Developer-Community/pulls.

If there isn't an existing issue there, please file an issue. The
ideal report includes:

-  A description of the problem/suggestion.
-  How to recreate the bug.

-  If possible, create a pull request with a (failing) test case
   demonstrating what's wrong. This makes the process for fixing bugs
   quicker & gets issues resolved sooner.
